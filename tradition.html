But the significance of Indian culture is that it is a scientific process towards human liberation and well-being. No other culture has looked at a human being with as much depth and understanding as this culture has. No other culture has looked at it as a science and created methods to evolve a person into his ultimate nature. We know if you do certain things, this will happen to a human being. To put it very bluntly, I would say we have technologies as to how to manufacture an enlightened being.</div>

                                <p>Our ancient medicine Ayurveda strongly recommends drinking water stored in copper vessels daily for boosting immune system and for balancing all the three doshas – vata, kapha and pitta. Ayurvedic practitioners refer water stored in copper vessels as ‘Tamra Jal’ and this copperized liquid serves as a natural oxidant.

                                    In addition, copper comes with significant amounts of antimicrobial properties making it ideal for eliminating disease causing bacteria, fungi and viruses. When water gets stored for up to 8 hours in a copper bottle or a vessel, it undergoes oligodynamic effect, which means it gains the ability to kill several infection causing microbes, fungi besides maintaining the natural PH levels. </p>

                                    Besides killing highly resistant bacteria, fungus and virus copper water is a treasure trove of medicinal properties that can play a pivotal role in maintaining the overall health.

It turns out, walking barefoot on grass has its share of benefits as well. When we walk barefoot our skin comes in contact with the earth directly and the negative ions present in the earth can help balance the positive ions in our body creating a balance that improves our health in many ways. While walking barefoot on grass, the pressure on your feet gets activated and gives your body energy as well as improves your health. Experts recommend walking barefoot on grass early in the morning as it boosts immunity and also improves eyesight. Not only this, there are many health benefits to your body if you take a stroll, barefoot, on grass.</p>

                                <p>Cow, in the Indian culture, is considered to be a Holy animal. She is worshipped as a maternal figure and is a depiction of the bounty of Mother Earth. Lord Krishna, who grew up as cow herder is often depicted as playing his flute among cows and Gopis (milkmaids) dancing to his tunes. Interestingly, Lord Krishna is also known by the name of 'Govinda' or 'Gopala', which translates to the 'friend and protector of cow'. Hence, cows have an auspicious significance in Indian Culture and religion.</p>

Thus, feeding a cow or making contributions for cow shelters is of immense religious importance for Indians. The Vedic scriptures, in various verses, have emphasised the need to protect and care for cows. Cows are a source of life-sustaining milk. Even the cow dung is an essential and energy-efficient source of fuel, especially in rural India. Killing the cow or consuming cow meat is considered to be a sin. Hence, several states in India have banned the slaughter of cows by law. Mother cow is, however, not worshipped as other deities. The religion and culture of India appreciate and expresses its gratitude towards this innocent animal who gives back to mother Earth and its people in more than one form.</p>

                                <p>The concept of arranged marriage in India traces its origin to as early as the Vedic times. For royal families, a ceremony known as the 'Swayambar' would be arranged for the bride. Suitable matches from all over the kingdom were invited to either compete in some competition to win over the bride, or the bride would herself choose her ideal husband. Even today, the concept of arranged marriage remains a favourite among Indians and is an integral part of 'Indian Traditions'.</p>

Fingers being heat receptors, they prevent your mouth from burning when the hot food is put inside. You get to check the temperature before eating the food. Other than that, you tend to eat slower when you dine with hands â€” this aids in digestion. Traditionally, the right side is used to eat, and the left hand is considered to be dirty. One must thoroughly wash his/her hands with soap and water before eating. This practice makes the eating process very hygienic. Eating with hands is a widespread practice in South and East India, but it's a bit rare in North and West India. In North and West India, people use spoons to pick up the rice to eat but use fingers to break down the bread. </p>
